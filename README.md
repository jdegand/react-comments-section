## My process

### Built with

- React

### What I learned

- My initial hesitation at changing the initial data.json file made this much harder.
- Flat data is best. 

### Continued development

- Edit Functionality
- Styling
- Limit clicking like button again w/ a flag or other method
- Real crud with database
- When you add a comment with short amount of text, it will look like a reply since the comment doesn't have a min-width.  
- Don't know why adding picture causes app to crash in CommentForm
